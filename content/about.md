## About Me ##

Hi, my name is Tatsat, I'm an honors computer science student and software developer currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at Arizona State University. I have a deep passion for the craft of Software Engineering and am on a long journey of becoming a highly competent developer. On this website I hope to document my journey through show-casing personal projects and dev-logs.

### Prior Experiences ###

I've been programming for a long time now, across a variety of paradigms and languages. I started with Java before moving to python to learn basic ML and data science. From there I was immersed in HTML/CSS and Javascript, getting a lot of reps with Full stack development. I particularly used React.js, MERN stack, and occasionaly firebase.

In this past year I've spent most of my time in C/C++, getting much more proficient with my data structures and algorithms, learning more general-purpose software engineering and building much more complex systems in team-based environments.

At this point my experience has spanned everything from low-level programming to Cybersecurity to Full-Stack development to functional programming to low-level programming with x86 and MIPS assembly.

### How I Work ###

I pride myself on a strong work ethic and creative spirit. I believe in developing every day and a constant effort to improve. I’ve worked in both academic and entrepreneurial environments, where I’ve learned to balance structure with creativity, and vision with execution.

In team settings, I value clear communication, mutual respect, and shipping clean, maintainable code. I’ve managed projects, led development efforts, written high-impact documentation, and facilitated collaboration across platforms like GitHub, Slack, and AirTable.

Whether you’re here to see my projects, read about my latest developments, or get in touch—I’m glad you’re here. Let’s build something great.

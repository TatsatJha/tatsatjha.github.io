So I've been working a lot on leetcode the past couple of months but recently I've been
stumbling around the world of competitive programming. I've been enjoying this topic
because it feels like everything I'm learning really goes well with the leetcode I've been
working on while also helping me to better understand some of the concepts and the mindset
when it comes to solivng these interview style questions.

Right now I'm working my way through the competivive programming handbook and I'm going
to work my way through some of the problems on [cses.fi](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).

My intention is to have better fundamental skills whne it comes to solving
leetocde style problems and thne I'm going to go throuhg the blind 75 problems
again and hopefully breeze thorugh them without help.

That's the intention, but now I just have to go thorugh the handbook and teach
myself appropriately.

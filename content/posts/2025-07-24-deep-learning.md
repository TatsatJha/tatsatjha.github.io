With the alog-vis project mostly complete I've decided to go deeper into the
world of AI and trying to get a much deeper understanding of the field.

I've used several AI algorithms before to test and train models. I recall using
K-nearst neighbors, K-means clustering, I've done research on neural networks
and I've obviously recently used some open source pre-trained models for the
Jarvis project.

Going into deep learning I've of course taken a lot of math classes including
linear algebra and a lot of statistics which is most of what deep learning is
predicated on.

I'm going though a pytorch deep learning course from freecodecamp and I'm
enjoying it so far. Everything is making sense, really it's just been a lot of
learning and practicing working with tensors which I'm very familir with.

I'm only a few hours into the course right now but I'm hoping by the end of the
course to work on a facial recognition model. I think that would be a really fun
project to work on and integrate into the Jarvis project so he can recognize
people who have scanned their face into Jarvis's database.

But yeah that the update on me trying to learn deep learning, and we will see
where it goes.

So I've been doing a lot of work on the Vantage-Fit project and I've been
starting off by doing a big UI overhaul. I've acutally been using a lot of AI
for this because frankly it's just bettere at coming up with good css ideas for
me and it's really easy with something like supermaven and tailwind to style the
fontend.

I've decided to do the UI overhaul mainly because I was unhappy with parts of
the exercise builder. The spacing was inefficient and the UI itself looked
clunky but with the help of supermaven we've gottena lot better of a UI going
for us. 

The drag and drop functionality which I wrote last year when I started tinkering
on this project is mostly the same but the app itself is looking much better. We
have a good dashboard setup that will display a one-week training history. We've
got the Discover pages setup and I'm working a lot now on integrating the
backend.

Obviously I've mentioned that I'm using firebase for this proeject so that the
mobile app should be able to sync with our backend super easily and it seems
like the most viable option for an MVP.

I'm working on setting up the UI for the exercise runner as well now. So in a
few weeks this project should be a rather competent training app and then of
course we will need to elevate it with an AI toolkit, essentially turning the
app into a competent but cheap personal trainer.

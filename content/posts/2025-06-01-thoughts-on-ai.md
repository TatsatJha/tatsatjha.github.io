i've been doing a lot of work on several different projects this summer and I've had to think a lot in terms of AI. What tools I should be using, what applications should I be using these tools in and how can I really maximine both my learnign expereince and my ability to build quickly and leverage the speed benefits of AI without introducing horrenodous lines of code.

I think I've definitely swung form one side of the the pendulumu to the other and back and forht over the past year. I was intilaly using no AI at all this time last year, believing it best fror the larning expereince and then I embraced it fully, getting a lot fo pseed ups in my personal projects and then afterward I noticed it was reducing my ability to think for myself particularly in lettcode-esque problems. At which point I really began being very intentionaly with how I use AI in my devleopment.

Right now, my main forms of using AI are really as a powerful autocomplete. Currently I'm running supermacen on vscode. I tried running github copilot a while back but it seems they have not really updated much since the era of GPT-3 so cpilot is dead i the water to me. Supermaven has been nie. It's a nice autocomplete and I find I'm acle to focus more on higher level thinjking while also not being robbed of my thought process while I develop. Currently it's a happy-medium for me and I've noticed the most benfitis in this approach compared to any others thus far.

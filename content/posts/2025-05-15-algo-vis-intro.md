This is the last real idea I have for projects, at least for now. I've wanted to make algorithm visualizers for certain algorithms for a while now. Specifically, I really enjoy the idea of visualizing path-finding algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's is the main one I've comprehensively learned about in my courses thus far.

The interesting thing I noticed during my Data Structures and Algorithms courses was that I really benefited from using a visual representation of the algorithm. And for a lot of algorithms there was a good visual representation available online. The only case in which this wasn't true was for path-finding algorithms so that's why I'm focusing on these algorithms for this project.   

I started work on this project today and I've gotten most of the ui setup and I have a basic dijsktra's algorithm working. I'm wrestling with how I want to store the data for each Vertex and Edge and how best to visualize that. We'll decide in the future.

Long term I could see potential in either putting this project up online and potentially help out young programmers to understand path finding algorithms or perhaps even handing this off to ASU and letting them use it as a learning aid.
